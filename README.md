This repo is the official implementation of ["Deep-learning-enabled crack detection and analysis in commercial lithium-ion battery cathodes"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202203070). It currently includes code for the following tasks:

## Abstract

In Li-ion batteries, the mechanical degradation initiated by micro cracks is one of the bottlenecks for enhancing the performance. Quantifying the crack formation and evolution in complex composite electrodes can provide important insights into electrochemical behaviors under prolonged and/or aggressive cycling. However, observation and interpretation of the complicated crack patterns in battery electrodes through imaging experiments are often time-consuming, labor intensive, and subjective. Herein, we develop a deep learning-based approach to extract the crack patterns from nanoscale hard X-ray holo-tomography data of a commercial 18650-type battery cathodes. We demonstrate efficient and effective quantification of the damage heterogeneity with automation and statistical significance. We further associate the crack characteristics with the active particlesâ€™ packing densities and discuss a potentially viable architectural design for suppressing the structural degradation in an industry-relevant battery configuration.
